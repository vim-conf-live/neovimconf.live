## Requirements

Though I believe most of these requirements to be common sense as a frontend dev,
just to make sure we're on the same page:

- You can use everything in baseline 2024; or limited with a graceful fallback
- Check light and dark version
- Use semantic HTML
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Account for keyboard navigation
- and of course: responsive, mobile first

These are more general guidelines than requirements:

- Prefer tailwind for general layout on basic parts (padding, text-size etc)
- Write CSS when things get more complex or it cannot be expressed simply
    in tailwind (eg. when using `grid-template-area`)
