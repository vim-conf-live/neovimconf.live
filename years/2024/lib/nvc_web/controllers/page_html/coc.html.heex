    NeovimConf.live is an inclusive community.
  </p>
  <h2 id="join-us">Join Us!</h2>
  <p>
    We strive to create a friendly, welcoming, judgement- and harassment-free place for individuals to learn, connect, and share their appreciation for all things vim.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a diverse, global community. We have members from every gender, sexuality, gender expression, race, ethnicity, tribal background, religious affiliation, citizenship and nationality, age, physical ability, educational background, experience level that you can think of - and want everyone to feel welcome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether attending our events, it’s not only our hope, but our expectation, that you’ll abide by these three basic ground rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care.
      <li>
        We are patient &amp; kind to others. We don’t dismiss someone because they have a different level of experience, are of a different background, or have a difference of opinion than us.
      </li>
    </li>
    <li>
      We are respectful when we disagree with someone.
      <li>
        There is a human in front of us. We don’t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We are collectively responsible for each other.
      </li>
    </li>
    <li>
      We work to correct mistakes when they occur.
      <li>
        No one is expected to always be perfect or to know everything - sometimes even good intentions have unwanted outcomes. But how we respond to criticism is important. If someone criticizes our conduct, or points out ways we have harmed someone, we listen without taking it personally, and work towards a resolution - together.
      </li>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="we-will-not-tolerate-the-following">We will not tolerate the following:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Violent threats or language.</li>
    <li>Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.</li>
    <li>Disrespecting people’s stated pronouns and gender identity, or current name.</li>
    <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
    <li>
      Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    </li>
    <li>Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.</li>
    <li>Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.</li>
    <li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If someone has said or done something that violates this code of conduct, please refer to the Resolving Code of Conduct Violations section.
  </p>
  <h2 id="discord-code-of-conduct">Discord Code of Conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Written communication is easy to misinterpret. Ask for clarification before jumping to conclusions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Respect and use the correct pronouns for people when referring to them. Ask if you are not sure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Respect people’s boundaries, don’t dm or continue to interact with people if they have asked you not to.
    </li>
    <li>Do not spam or solicit other participants</li>
    <li>
      Consider thoughtful use of discussion threads to help keep useful conversations focussed
    </li>
    <li>
      Select the most appropriate channel for your conversation and avoid reposting the same messages across many channels in ways which may feel spammy.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If something has happened that excludes you or is making you have a bad experience, here is what should happen next.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In the moment:</strong>
    Are you safe? If not, get to a safe place. Can you talk to someone you trust about what happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If it seems safe</strong>, try and speak with the person privately,
    <strong>in person</strong>
    if you can. Try and work to a resolution together. If it goes well, great! If it does not go well, please speak to an organizer as soon as you can.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If it does not seem safe</strong>, or the conversation did not go well, speak to an organizer about what happened as soon as you can.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>After the fact:</strong>
    Organizers are familiar with this Code of Conduct and will take reports of CoC violations seriously. They will ask you details such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>time / place / manner of the alleged violation.</li>
    <li>whether there were additional witnesses or other people involved.</li>
    <li>contact or identifying information about the person who allegedly violated the CoC.</li>
    <li>
      Whether or not you would prefer to have your complaint be kept anonymous in the situation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can help us by giving us much detail as you can about what occurred Organizers will work with staff to evaluate what happened, inform the person(s) in question that a violation was reported, and establish next steps.
  </p>
  <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
  <p>This Code of Conduct covers a variety of different spaces of interaction.</p>
  <p>If you’d like to report a CoC violation that happens…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      in the Discord Server, please speak to ABD. Please do note we may be out of your timezone, but we will respond.
    </li>
    <li>
      during our online events, please speak with the organizers, who can be reached in the discord server.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All group organizers are required to relay all reports of CoC violations and complaints to NeovimConf.live staff within one week, regardless of how “severe” they are, so we can be accountable and responsible for resolving issues promptly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on the severity of the issue, the person may receive a last-chance warning, may be asked to leave the activity/group, or may receive a future ban. In very severe cases, we reserve the right to involve law enforcement should we feel it necessary. Tickets or other participation fees won’t be refunded for people who are removed for CoC violations.
